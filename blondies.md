# Blondies

Recipe from [Smitten Kitchen - blondies, infinitely
adaptable](https://smittenkitchen.com/2006/11/blondies/)

## Ingredients

- [ ]  8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces, or 115 grams) unsalted butter
- [ ]  1 cup (190 grams) light or dark brown sugar
- [ ]  1 large egg
- [ ]  1 teaspoon vanilla extract
- [ ]  1/2 teaspoon flaky sea salt, or 1/4 teaspoon coarse sea salt
- [ ]  1 cup (130 grams) all-purpose flour
- [ ]  1 1/2 cups mix-ins of you choice (my favorite: 1 cup chocolate chips plus
  1/2 cup chopped toasted walnuts, see below for more suggestions)

## Method

1. Heat oven to 350°F (around 175°C). Butter an 8×8-inch (20cm x 20cm) baking pan, or line the bottom and two
   sides of one with parchment paper, buttering the exposed parts.
2. Melt butter in a small saucepan; I like to keep cooking it, stirring
   occasionally, until it becomes toasty and browned at the bottom and has an
   unbelievable aroma. It’s definitely worth the trouble here. Pour into a
   medium or large bowl and whisk in sugar until smooth. At this point, it
   should be cooled to lukewarm, but if it’s not, let it rest for a few minutes
   until it is, then whisk in egg, vanilla, and sea salt. Stir in flour and
   additions of your choice.
3. Scrape into prepared pan and smooth with spatula; the batter is thick and
   will take some nudging. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes, until lightly browned at
   edges but looks a tiny bit underbaked. (I always err on the side of caution
   with baking times — nobody ever complained about a gooey-middled cookie.) Let
   blondies cool in pan, or just let them cool in it for 10 minutes and use the
   parchment sling to slide them onto a cutting board. Cut into 16 or more
   squares.

## Storage

Leftover (ha!) blondies can be stored in an airtight container at room
temperature for up to a week.

## Ideas for mix-ins

Chopped nuts, toasting them first for better flavor; 2 tablespoons espresso
powder; 1/2 teaspoon mint or almond extract in place of the vanilla; 1/2 cup
dried fruit; 1/4 cup bourbon, scotch or other whiskey (increase the flour by 1
tablespoon); a mix of chopped chocolate or candy bars (toffee bits would be
fantastic here); peanut butter chips instead of chocolate chips.
