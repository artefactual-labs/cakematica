### Ingredients needed for the cake

- [ ]  ½ pound (2 sticks) unsalted butter
- [ ]  2½ cups sugar
- [ ]  4 large eggs
- [ ]  ⅓ cup grated lemon zest
- [ ]  3 cups flour
- [ ]  ½ teaspoon baking powder
- [ ]  ½ teaspoon baking soda
- [ ]  1 teaspoon salt
- [ ]  ½ cup lemon juice
- [ ]  ¼ cup lime juice
- [ ]  ¾ cup milk
- [ ]  1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

### Recipe for cake

1. Take ¾ cup of milk an add a teaspoon of lemon juice to it. Set it aside for 15 mins (optionally you can skip this step and use market bought buttermilk instead).
2. Cream the butter and 2 cups sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy.
3. Separate the egg white and yolk from the eggs. Add a little bit of water (about a teaspoon or so) to the egg whites and whisk them until it has completely turned to froth. Mix this froth with the butter and sugar mixture.
4. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. In another bowl, combine ¼ cup lime juice, the buttermilk (from step 2), and the vanilla extract. Whisk the yolks together and add them to the buttermilk mix.
5. Add the flour and buttermilk mixtures alternately to the batter (from step 3), beginning and ending with the flour.
6. Bake at 350F.
7. Combine ½ cup lemon juice with ½ cup sugar in a saucepan and cook over low heat until the sugar is fully dissolved. After the cake has cooled a little, spread this syrup over the cake.

### For the glaze

- [ ]  3½ tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice
- [ ]  2 cups confectioners sugar

### Recipe for glaze

1. Mix the confectioners sugar with the lemon juice until completely dissolved.
2. Spread it over on top of the cake and the sides (use a pastry brush if you wish).
